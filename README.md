Write a Python program that keeps information about students. A student will have the attributes

the student information. The array should be able to contain 100 students.
Your program should have the following menu structure:

4- Find a student by student number, and show all the information about that student, including the age of the student
5- Show all students (all the information about them: name, lastname, age etc.)
6- Show all students who were born in a given year (e.g. 2000)
7- Modify a student record: input the student number, ask the field to modify, and get the new value from the user. Modify the record accordingly.
